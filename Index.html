	<H2> 1. Basic Information</H2>
	<P><q>The cars we drive say a lot about us.</q>(Alexandra Pa). If you were driving a Buick Grand National, that meant that you wanted speed, speed, and then more speed simply because this was the fastest car produced in the year 1987. The Buick Grand National first hit the market in 1982 from that moment on it revolutionized the car market. It was the first car to institute a turbo with a V6 engine which guarantees power while getting efficient gas millage.</P>
	<p><em>For more information on the Grand National:</em> <A Href ="http://www.topspeed.com/cars/buick/1982-1987-buick-grand-national-ar139782.html">http://www.topspeed.com/cars/buick/1982-1987-buick-grand-national-ar139782.html </A></P>

	<H2>2. Engine</H2>
	<P>The Grand National was Buick’s answer to the sport cars of Chevrolet, Ford, and Pontiac. To make the car stand out, Buick implemented a V-6 engine with a turbo which was the <b>first of its kind in the history of the car industry</b>.  In 1987 it was the fastest car on the market pushing 276 horsepower with a ¼ mile time of 14.23 seconds.</P>

	<P> This is an image under the hood of a 1987 Buick Grand National. You can see the turbo beside the engine coolant tank and attached to the vacuum line that runs under the vacuum line attached to the block of the engine. This turbo was what made the Grand National unique. A smaller turbo was in the Grand National while a larger one was put in the upgraded Buick GNX. </P>
